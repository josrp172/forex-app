Title: ✨ Simple Christmas Hello ✨
Message:
Rio, advance Merry Christmas! 🎄
Gusto ko lang magsimula by saying how much I respect you—not just for your work, but for the way you carry yourself. Calm ka, maayos ka kausap, and may presence ka na nakaka-set ng tone sa room.

[SCENE 2]
Title: 🌙 A Heavy Year 🌙
Message:
I know this year wasn’t easy for you. Marami kang pinagdaanan, and I know it wasn’t something you chose or expected. Hindi palaging sinasabi, pero just know na may mga taong handang tumulong at sumuporta habang binabangon mo ulit ang sarili mo.

[SCENE 3]
Title: 💪 Facing Hard Challenges 💪
Message:
What I admire about you is how you accept hard challenges.
Kahit mahirap, you still show up, you still face things head-on, and you don’t let the situation define you. That takes strength—not everyone has that.

[SCENE 4]
Title: 🧠 Skill + Composure 🧠
Message:
I also respect your technical skills—solid at maaasahan. Kahit may stress, hindi mo hinahayaang maapektuhan yung work mo. Calm ka pa rin, maayos ka kausap, and steady sa output.

[SCENE 5]
Title: 🌅 Christmas Wishes 🌅
Message:
Merry Christmas sayo, sa family mo, at sa mga mahal mo sa buhay 🎄🤍
Sana this season gives you rest, healing, and a bit of peace. And as you recover and move forward, know na hindi ka nag-iisa—nandito lang kami.
